Built a mobile app to promote community engagement on React.JS in an HCI class at Stanford. We started by interviewing our intended user base: civic-oriented community builders. 
- We gathered feedback early and often, using an experience prototype, wireframes, interactive proto.io prototype
- Final product was a frontend app in react mobile via exponent

Machine learning project for our final project in AI Principles at Stanford. We were drawn to build a lipreader because of the complexity and direct use-cases for assisting people with hearing impairments. 
- Takes in a short clip of a subject speaking one phoneme and produces an array containing the estimated probabilities that that clip corresponds to any particular phoneme
-  We also built an NLP model, so that the phoneme classifier could be used to move from audio-free video to a full reconstruction of a spoken sentence.
- Implemented using Python, and Keras, and borrowing ideas for spatio-temporal convolutional neural network from Lipnet.

Audio-visual game for Music, Computing, and Design class with Ge Wang. Light up the tunnel by colliding with the spheres that come your way. 
- Pick an audio track to play with. Used Aubio to parse music for drum onset so I could sync game elements with it.
