## [](#header-3)dappTX (in progress)
[code](https://github.com/maxwolff/dappTx){: style="color:blue; font-size: 120%; text-align: left;"}

Visualizes transaction volume of biggest ethereum smart contracts. Pulls data from Infura API, chron job populates a Postgres DB, Node/Express web app exposes the data with graphs on the front end.
- Supported as an open-source project by Gitcoin.co

## [](#header-3)PAD Piper
[code](https://github.com/maxwolff/vasctrac){: style="color:blue; font-size: 120%; text-align: left;"}

Winner of the Vasctrac Data Challenge at Health ++ 2017. We worked with a vascular health research group focusing on Peripheral Arterial Disease to interpret raw sensor data from a 6 minute walking test (accelerometer data from iphone, no gyroscope). 
- Used DSP methods to create an 92% accurate step counter (iPhone is 94%)
- Built predictors for Ankle Brachial Index and distance walked

## [](#header-3)Heap Allocator
[assignment](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs107/cs107.1166/assign7/){: style="color:blue; font-size: 120%; text-align: left;"} 

Pair prorammed a heap allocator in C for "Computer Organizations & Systems" at Stanford. Implemented  malloc, realloc, and free functionality. Our allocator assigned memory addresses individually, optimizing for memory utilization, througput, and correctness. 
- Used a double linked list of freed blocks embedded in the heap. 
- Achieved 70% of the standard C library function's utilization rate.

Built a mobile app to promote community engagement on React.JS in an HCI class at Stanford. We started by interviewing our intended user base: civic-oriented community builders. 
- We gathered feedback early and often, using an experience prototype, wireframes, interactive proto.io prototype
- Final product was a frontend app in react mobile via exponent

[class](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs221/){: style="color:blue; font-size: 120%; text-align: left;"} 

Machine learning project for our final project in AI Principles at Stanford. We were drawn to build a lipreader because of the complexity and direct use-cases for assisting people with hearing impairments. 
- Takes in a short clip of a subject speaking one phoneme and produces an array containing the estimated probabilities that that clip corresponds to any particular phoneme
-  We also built an NLP model, so that the phoneme classifier could be used to move from audio-free video to a full reconstruction of a spoken sentence.
- Implemented using Python, and Keras, and borrowing ideas for spatio-temporal convolutional neural network from Lipnet.

## [](#header-2)Tunnel

[class](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/courses/256a-fall-2015/){: style="color:blue; font-size: 120%; text-align: left;"} 

Audio-visual game for Music, Computing, and Design class with Ge Wang. Light up the tunnel by colliding with the spheres that come your way. 
- Pick an audio track to play with. Used Aubio to parse music for drum onset so I could sync game elements with it.
